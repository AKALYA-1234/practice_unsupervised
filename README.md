🌟 Clustering Practice Tasks

This project is all about learning clustering algorithms in a simple and practical way.
We explore three of the most important methods:

🟢 KMeans Clustering

🔵 Hierarchical Clustering

🟣 DBSCAN Clustering


📘 What You’ll Learn

✨ How clustering groups data without labels
✨ How to visualize and interpret results
✨ The difference between centroid-based, hierarchical, and density-based clustering



Practice Tasks
🔹 Task 1: KMeans with Iris Dataset

Use the classic Iris dataset

Find clusters using KMeans

Compare them with the actual flower species 🌸

💡 Expected: Accuracy ~90% (approx, since clustering is unsupervised)


🔹 Task 2: Hierarchical Clustering on Customers

Use income and spending score data 🛒

Perform Agglomerative Clustering

Visualize relationships with a Dendrogram 🌳

💡 Expected: You’ll see how customers naturally form groups



🔹 Task 3: DBSCAN with Noisy Data

Generate moon-shaped synthetic data 🌙

Apply DBSCAN to detect clusters + noise

Outliers are labeled as -1 🚫

💡 Expected: Two nice moon clusters + scattered noise points



🎯 Skills Gained

✔️ Hands-on with unsupervised learning
✔️ How to choose clustering methods for different data
✔️ Visualizing clusters with matplotlib



🚀 Next Step

Once you finish these tasks, try:

Using your own dataset

Comparing silhouette scores

Tuning hyperparameters (eps in DBSCAN, n_clusters in KMeans)
